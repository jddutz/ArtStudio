# ArtStudio

ArtStudio is an experimental project exploring the combination of generative AI tools with basic user interface and graphics editing features. The goal is to experiment with new creative workflows and technologies, not to replace industry-standard tools or provide a comprehensive, professional-grade experience.

## Project Goals
- Experiment with integrating generative AI into simple digital art and graphics editing workflows
- Provide a minimal, approachable UI for testing ideas and features
- Encourage learning, prototyping, and community feedback

## Features (Experimental / In Progress)
- Basic digital painting and drawing tools
- Simple layer management
- Generative AI-powered image suggestions or enhancements
- Ability to use local and/or cloud-based AI models
- Basic image editing (crop, resize, simple filters)
- Minimal import/export support (PNG, JPEG)

## Technology Stack
- Platform: Windows (with possible future support for other platforms)
- Language: [To be specified]
- Frameworks: [To be specified]
